## Overview
This project is basically about a product preview card's design, that involves knowledge in both HTML and CSS.


## My process
it took me three days to finish working on this project, i thought i would finish earlier than that since i have learnt alot of concepts in CSS and HTML already. But i came to realize that learning code is very much different from trying things out yourself.
But i am proud i could pull this off, my design might not be the xerox copy of what i cloned but i learnt alot!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
